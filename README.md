## <a name="Introduction"/>Introduction

Jenerate is a Java Generation plugin for Eclipse that provides customizable code generation for Java classes.

Jenerate provides code generation for methods like:

* hashCode() and equals() (ALT+SHIFT+G then H)
* toString() (ALT+SHIFT+G then S)
* compareTo() (ALT+SHIFT+G then C)

The generated methods can use internal java.util.Objects class or external libraries such as Apache commons-lang[3] Builders and Google Guava.

A certain number of parameters can be customized in the Jenerate preference page in eclipse (Window > Preferences > Java > Jenerate).
